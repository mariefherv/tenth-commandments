        The Art of Multitasking

There are very few jobs that do not require multitasking skills of some sort or another. Employees rarely have the luxury of focusing on one task at a time in today's work world.

<br><br>
Most jobs require employees to balance competing demands for their time and energy, and employers expect you to be able to handle multiple priorities. Even if you don't think you do much of it, you are most likely multitasking much of the time.

<br><br>
When you are job searching, employers will want to know that you have the ability to multitask successfully. So, it is important to be ready to share examples, during your job interviews, of how you have handled multiple tasks or projects in the past.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">What is Multitasking?</font><br>
Multitasking entails juggling different work activities and shifting attention from one task to another.

<br><br>
Ideally, an employee will be able to meet the demands of several different stakeholders without dropping the ball.  The danger in multitasking is that effectiveness can be compromised if the worker tries to carry out too many tasks at the same time.  

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">Technology and Multitasking</font><br>
Modern technology complicates the situation for many workers since they are expected to handle simultaneous demands through email, text messages, phone calls, and in-person contact with constituents. It's become the norm to check your phone and your email while working on other tasks.

<br><br>
Jobs that require intense concentration on complex tasks and also entail frequent interaction with others can be particularly challenging. It can be hard to focus when you're trying to do too many things at once, and it's important to be able to manage your workload.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">How (and How Not) to Successfully Multitask</font><br>
Employees who multitask effectively must be able to rotate their concentration smoothly and entirely from one activity to another.

<br><br>
In order to multitask successfully, workers must be able to prioritize tasks and address the most critical and pressing demands first.

<br><br>
It's also important to know when multitasking is a bad idea. There are certain jobs and tasks where you need to work on one thing at a time. Be cognizant of that when you're interviewing and be sure to tailor your response to questions to the job you're being considered for.
