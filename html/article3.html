        10 Tips to Improve Cybersecurity
    </font><br><br>

A friend asked me to list all of the cybersecurity things that bug me and what he should be diligent about regarding user security. We talked about access control lists, MAC layer spoofing, and a bunch of other topics and why they mattered. You should come up with a list of head-desk things.

<br><br>
After a bit of thought, here is a list. It is by NO means comprehensive, and it is not an organized best practices document. Instead, these are marbles that roll around in my head and bother me a lot.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">1. Ban and route to null t.co, bit.ly, and other URL shorteners
</font><br>
Why? Especially in phishing emails, a user has no idea where the link is going, what is behind that link, or what kind of benevolent or conversely malicious payload is going to load in the default browser. Sure, your anti-malware or antivirus tool, or even the own instinct of the browser, might prevent a page load that opens a back door into your network. Maybe.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">2. Allow browsers to force https
</font><br>
Firefox and Chrome both have this feature. Lots of sites have log-ons on http where credentials are in plaintext on your network, or even the internet routing path in general that expose log-ons. Firefox now defaults to smacking users that try to use auto-fill on http sites. Educate users about this. And if, heaven forbid, your site has a log-on over http, you need to turn in your security stirrups while your horse still rides. 

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">3. Update your asset lists monthly
</font><br>
There is too much change. Insurance companies love receipts and having things in order, as do police departments which the insurance companies must have a report from. Yes, there is something to the tactic of taking a video of all your stuff, as well as the serial numbers, on a periodic basis and uploading it to two places. 

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">4. Go through and delete expired browser certificates
</font><br>
Get rid of them. Allow users to get scary error messages when something tries to route them to somewhere expired so that they do not swallow the next thing that inevitably arrives: the forged certificate open-wide page. Face it, you need a key management system and rigorous enforcement once the trial has been completed. Key managers are worth their weight in stolen assets. 

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">5. Client hosts files do not work. But router hosts files do 
</font><br>
In my personal opinion, Microsoft should be banned for ignoring a hosts file, the file that contains hosts and IP addresses. It is done because this can disrupt Active Directory under some circumstances, so they ignore the file. 

The problem is there are many well-thought cogent lists of fake and misspelled sites in hosts files that can prevent users from shooting themselves in the spelling foot. This is such an unholy act that Microsoft should be spanked.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">6. Inventory your OS assets review
</font><br>
Running scans of your network for new and unknown MAC addresses means you have perhaps discovered new purchases or worse, newly implanted machinery on your network. After reading of the new DISHWASHER CVE , you have no idea until you have done the work of slogging through your ACLs and MAC address tables to look for the new backdoors into your network.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">7. Do sanity check meetings
</font><br>
If you are on a security team, schedule regular meetings with other departments within IT. Let people voice their concerns. Remind people of organizational security needs. Allow yourselves time to physically visit important assets. Several eyes on assets might reveal something new or strange to investigate.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">8. Read the damn logs
</font><br>
There are lots of great syslog amalgamation services that read Microsoft and standard syslog files. Filter and read them. Act upon what you see. The logs are there for a reason. Yes, Facebook can be more interesting, but read the damn logs. 

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">9. Have a new hire systems security orientation
</font><br>
Security at other organizations ranges from tight to non existent and everything in between. When a new hire comes on board, presume they know nothing at all about your organizational security mandates. Best practices for many organizations include training on SarbanesOxley, HIPPA and other industry tenets. But security in every business segment is different. At minimum, make it a video with a quiz. Then you have established a baseline.

<br><br>
<font face="edo" size="4">10. Go outside
</font><br>
Although it seems counterintuitive, constant brainstorming drains you. Team time and alone time are a better mix, as sitting at a desk for hours at a time becomes fatiguing. Get outside no matter the weather. Oxygenate. Get away from email, Slack, online management monitors the whole mess. Refreshed, your mind will be more lucid to be ready for the next period of madness.
